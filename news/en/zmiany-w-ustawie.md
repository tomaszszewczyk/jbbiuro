# Amendments to the act - Code of Commercial Companies and some other acts

On April 12, 2022, the Act of February 9, 2022 amending the Act - Code of Commercial Companies and certain other acts was published (Journal of Laws, item 807), which, inter alia, changes some rules for determining the basis for calculating the health insurance premium - the basis takes into account inventory differences (but in 2022 only to the benefit of the taxpayer), and also omits some income (amounts exempt from tax or subject to omission, part of income from the sale of fixed assets) .

These changes are one of the attempts to fix the Polish Order and were consulted with the SKwP. Another amendment to the regulations, primarily in the field of PIT and health insurance premiums, is currently the subject of legislative work. In this case, the Association also actively participates in consulting the proposed changes.
