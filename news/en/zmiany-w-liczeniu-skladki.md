# Changes in the calculation of health contributions

President Andrzej Duda signed the act of February 9, 2022 amending the act - the Code of Commercial Companies and some other acts. The amendment to, inter alia, modifies the rules for determining income for the calculation of health insurance by entrepreneurs, which will be calculated taking into account inventory differences. Thanks to this, companies that bought goods in 2021 and will not sell them, for example, until 2022, will take into account the expenses for purchases when calculating the health insurance premium.

When determining the income for the calculation of the health insurance contribution, the inventory differences will be taken into account, i.e. also the purchases from previous years.

Thanks to this, entrepreneurs will calculate income for the purposes of health insurance on the basis of similar principles as in the case of income tax.

The change, which is the implementation of the entrepreneurs' postulate, results from the amendment to the Code of Commercial Companies and certain other acts, which was signed by the President.
