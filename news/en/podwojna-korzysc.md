# Double tax advantage for helping Ukraine

Both CIT and PIT taxpayers may deduct from their income the value of donations made to non-governmental organizations for
counteracting the effects of war, when they previously included the donated items or property rights as costs
obtaining income. This is the result of the entry into force of the Act of April 8, 2022 amending the Act on assistance to Ukrainian citizens in
in connection with an armed conflict in the territory of that state and certain other acts (item 830), which in this respect
entered into force on April 15, 2022.
