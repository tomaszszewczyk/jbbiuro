# New e-service of specialized invoicing for entrepreneurs

A new e-specialized invoicing service for entrepreneurs on the Electronic Invoicing Platform has been launched.

Thanks to additional functions, entrepreneurs will be able to issue an invoice for deliveries of mass services more easily, e.g. electricity or telecommunications.

The extended standard of the invoice will enable the inclusion of additional methods of VAT calculation - in accordance with the requirements of the Act on Value Added Tax.

The new e-service will also allow for issuing a corrective note and sending a business reaction to the received document, e.g. its acceptance or rejection.

The standard of the correcting invoice was also modified and expanded, and the entire system was supplemented with a factoring module. Also new is the ability to download recipient data from the central address book.
